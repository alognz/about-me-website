    <h2>a bit about myself (alondra) </h2>
    <p> currently, i am a sophomore at wright college
      studying computer science! 
    </p>
    <p>i am the president of the  society of women engineers - wright affiliate, and also the leader of a research group focusing on the development of a mentor-mentee matching application. i can thus say that i am a person who likes to lead!</p>
    <p>i am currently also a near-peer mentor for dpi's discover computing program, which serves to expose high school students to computer science and the opportunities it can provide. </p>
    <h4>a few things I like are...</h4>

      <li>cats (i have two)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>my favorite food...</h4>
    <p> is the doner kebab! i discovered my love for it when i traveled to vienna this past summer and there was a vendor on every corner. i was really hungry and only had a few euros on me, so i decided to buy one not knowing what it was and low and behold--ITS NOW MY FAV!!
